This repo is meant for supporting a public, open source SkyWatch system.

What this means:
1.  One aspect of the project is development of a star/planet filter (unassisted eyes/cameras - magnitude 6).
2.  A future aspect will be integrating those feeds (and thermal potentially) with SLAM.
3.  To include code for picking up ADSB with SDR.
4.  Potentially - passive radar with SDR.
5.  Code to interoperate with other stations to put together a networked view.
